# Build 50 things

Getting out of comfort zone and building things with technologies I've never worked with? Sounds good, and I will test this idea in this repo.

## Rules

- I will dedicate max 1-2/hours week
- Things will be fairly simple, focusing on one technology or one aspect of product
- Each challenge will have different technology
- There's no deadline / timeframe. Consistency is the key!
